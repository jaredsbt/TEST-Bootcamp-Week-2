<!-- Cookies and Cream Brownies

Soft and gooey on the inside, crisp on the outside dark chocolate brownies are topped with a layer of creamy topping and crushed cookies in this decadent but easy dessert.

Ingredients

    1 ½ cups white sugar

    ¾ cup all-purpose flour

    ½ cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder

    ½ teaspoon salt

    ¼ teaspoon baking powder

    ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted

    3 large eggs

    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

    32 chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®), divided

    1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

Directions

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.

    Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.

    Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well combined.

    Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with a spatula. Add 16 OREO® cookies in an even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies), then spread the remaining 1/2 of the batter over top.

    Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.

    Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.

    Crush 12 of the remaining OREO® cookies. Place the whipped topping in a bowl and fold in the crushed cookies. Spread over the top of the brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies, then sprinkle over the top of the whipped cream mixture.

    Keep refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve.  -->
